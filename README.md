## Project Overview

This project provides **valuable insights for telecom providers** by analyzing and segmenting over **38,000 enriched residential customer profiles** across the U.S., with a special emphasis on **Nevada, Florida, and Vermont**. The primary objective was to understand demographic patterns, assess broadband needs, and recommend **targeted service strategies** to enhance customer satisfaction and improve market reach.

## Key Achievements

- Employed **K-Means Clustering** to categorize customers into 5 distinct segments based on demographic and geographic variables.  
- Applied **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to determine the most influential factors driving customer segmentation.  
- Used **Chi-Square Tests** to select significant categorical features for deeper analysis.  
- Conducted **sub-clustering** to uncover detailed differences within rural and urban populations.  
- Performed a **state-level analysis** focusing on Nevada, Florida, and Vermont to generate localized recommendations.  
- Presented findings through **interactive Tableau dashboards** and supported them with **Python-based statistical modeling**.
